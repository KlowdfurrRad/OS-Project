# Ideas for FILE I/O Wrapperes

## 1. Logging and Auditing Access
**Purpose:** Track file access patterns for auditing or debugging.  
**Implementation:** Create wrappers around `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()` to log details such as timestamp, file descriptor, file path, user ID, and size of data transferred.  
**Enhancement:** Use kernel ring buffer (via `printk`) or relay buffers for high-frequency logging.

## 2. Custom Caching Mechanism
**Purpose:** Improve read performance by caching frequently accessed data.  
**Implementation:** Wrap `read()` to check if the requested data is already in a custom cache before actually reading from the disk. Similarly, `write()` wrappers can update the cache before writing to disk.  
**Enhancement:** Use a hash map or an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache within the kernel, or manage pages directly in the page cache for high-speed access.

## 3. Error Injection for Testing
**Purpose:** Simulate failures for stress-testing applications that rely on file I/O.  
**Implementation:** Inject errors (e.g., returning `-EIO` or `-ENOSPC`) in wrappers based on configurable parameters such as the number of calls or specific processes.  
**Enhancement:** Combine with fault injection frameworks in the kernel, allowing the error conditions to be dynamically controlled.

## 4. Rate Limiting File Access
**Purpose:** Control and limit file access rates per user or process.  
**Implementation:** Wrap around `open()` and `read()` to track the number of accesses per second for each process. If a process exceeds a threshold, throttle or deny further access.  
**Enhancement:** Use cgroups to manage rate limiting per group, allowing the wrapper to control access per user-defined categories.

## 5. Access Control and Permissions Enforcement
**Purpose:** Provide finer-grained control over who can access files and how they can access them.  
**Implementation:** Wrap `open()` to check additional permissions (based on user ID, file path, or custom rules) before permitting access.  
**Enhancement:** Integrate with SELinux or AppArmor policies for layered security control, and apply dynamic rule adjustments from user-space via `ioctl` or `netlink`.

## 6. Data Scrubbing or Encryption on Write
**Purpose:** Ensure data security by automatically encrypting or scrubbing data on write.  
**Implementation:** Wrap `write()` to perform encryption (e.g., using AES) on data before passing it to the actual system call. Decrypt data in `read()` before returning it to the application.  
**Enhancement:** Use a custom key management solution for encryption keys, accessible only by the kernel module.

## 7. File Activity Notifications
**Purpose:** Notify user-space applications of file operations.  
**Implementation:** Create wrappers around `open()`, `read()`, and `write()` to send notifications via netlink sockets or relay buffers to a listening user-space process.  
**Enhancement:** Include information about file descriptors, sizes, and operations, or integrate with the `inotify` API to complement `inotify` with more detailed low-level access information.

## 8. Resource Usage Tracking
**Purpose:** Track and limit resource consumption (such as file descriptors or disk space usage) by individual processes or users.  
**Implementation:** Wrap `open()`, `read()`, and `write()` to monitor resource usage per process. Enforce limits and return appropriate errors when limits are exceeded.  
**Enhancement:** Integrate with kernel resource tracking tools or cgroups for a more comprehensive resource monitoring system.

## 9. Asynchronous File Operations with Pre-fetching
**Purpose:** Enhance read/write performance by pre-fetching or pre-allocating data.  
**Implementation:** Wrap `read()` to launch a background read-ahead or `write()` to allocate pages asynchronously. This can improve performance for applications with predictable access patterns.  
**Enhancement:** Create configurable parameters to allow user-space applications to influence pre-fetching behavior dynamically.

## 10. Buffered Logging for High-Volume Applications
**Purpose:** Reduce I/O overhead for applications that generate high volumes of log data.  
**Implementation:** Wrap `write()` to buffer log data and write it to the disk only when a certain buffer size is reached. For example, flush logs on a periodic basis or when the buffer reaches a threshold.  
**Enhancement:** Create a priority mechanism within the buffer to handle critical logs immediately while batch-processing non-critical ones.

## 11. Kernel-based Quarantine for Potentially Malicious Files
**Purpose:** Prevent execution or further access to suspicious files detected by scanning.  
**Implementation:** Wrap `open()` and check file attributes or use a virus-scanning hook before allowing access. If a file is flagged, move it to a quarantine location.  
**Enhancement:** Integrate with antivirus or IDS systems to trigger automated quarantine of files marked as suspicious.

These ideas can be implemented in a loadable kernel module (LKM) by intercepting calls using system call table manipulation or creating a dedicated kernel file system that applies these policies.
